  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  <p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, making them faster to execute.</p>
  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute as a function of the length of the input. It is typically expressed using notations such as O(n), where n is the size of the input.</p>
