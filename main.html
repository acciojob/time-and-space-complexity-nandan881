  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of its input size. Algorithms with better time complexity are considered efficient.</p>
  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as it runs. It is often expressed in terms of O(n), where n represents the size of the input.</p>
